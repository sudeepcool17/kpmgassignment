Challenge 3
===========

We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get back the value. How this is implemented is up to you.
Example Inputs
object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}
key = a/b/c
object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}
key = x/y/z
value = a
Hints:
We would like to see some tests. A quick read to help you along the way
We would expect it in any other language apart from elixir.

Once this has been completed please send us the output so we can get the ball rolling.

Solution:
=========
1. Open pycharm or any other ISE and create a new project
